            Through my internship, I gained hands-on experience with Microsoft Business Central, Excel, and Power Automate, which taught me how to manage large datasets, automate repetitive tasks, and improve accuracy in business processes. I've also applied my skills in projects like the Grilled Cheese Food Truck simulator and the Rev It Up recommendation system, which gave me experience with machine learning and data analysis.

            The areas of computer science I'm most interested in are automation and software development because they make work more efficient and reduce human error. I enjoy turning manual processes into automated solutions, these experiences have motivated me to keep learning and applying my skills to real world problems. Along with this, my involvement in AWICS and MAES has given me mentorship, networking, and professional growth that complement my technical skills.
